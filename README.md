### A few simple intel x86 assembly programs  
i searched a lot for an all-in-one tutorial, book or any other resource to learn NASM fast, but i couldnt find anything.  
so i created this repo to keep track of everything that i learn about x86 programming. this might help you if you are new to assembly and want to learn reversing, binary analysis or vulnerability research.  

### Usage  
just practice the lessons in order, all programs are well-commented and you should be able to get it with a basic knowledge of registers, stack and program execution cycle

# Contribution
