### A few simple intel x86 assembly programs  
Just a few NASM x86 simple programs i write to better understand assembly and intel IA-32. these are probably useless but might help you if you are new to assembly programming.    

### Usage  
just practice the lessons in order, all programs are well-commented and you should be able to get it with a basic knowledge of registers, stack and program execution cycle. use these commands to assemble and run the programs:  
`nasm -f elf app.asm`  
`ld -m elf_i386 app.o`  
`./a.out`
